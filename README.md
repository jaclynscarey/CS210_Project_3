# CS210 - Module 7 - Project Three

<details>
<summary>Project Summary</summary>

The project aimed to develop an item-tracking program for the Corner Grocer. The program reads a list of purchased items from an input file, provides functionalities such as looking up item frequencies, generating frequency lists and histograms, and backs up the data to a file. It assists the store in understanding purchasing patterns and optimizing their layout.

<details>
<summary>Achievements</summary>

I successfully implemented the required functionalities using C++, including a user-friendly menu system, data processing from the input file, item lookup, frequency list printing, and histogram generation. The code was well-documented, adhering to best practices and including error handling.

<summary>Areas for Enhancement</summary>

To enhance the code further, I could implement input validation for user choices and item names to ensure more secure and error-resistant user interactions. Additionally, incorporating exception handling could make the program more robust against unexpected errors during file operations.

<summary>Challenges and Resources</summary>

The most challenging part was designing the histogram and formatting the output correctly. I overcame this by carefully iterating through the data and formatting it step by step. Online C++ documentation and forums were helpful resources in solving this challenge.

<summary>Transferable Skills</summary>

The skills acquired from this project, such as file input/output handling, vector manipulation, user interface design, and error handling, will be valuable in future projects and coursework. The practice of designing user-friendly interfaces and implementing data analysis features will be particularly useful.

<details>
<summary>Maintainability and Readability</summary>

To ensure maintainability, I used meaningful variable names, followed consistent naming conventions, and inserted in-line comments to explain key steps. Additionally, I structured the code into functions, allowing for easy modification and extension. This code organization and documentation make the program more readable and adaptable for future changes.
